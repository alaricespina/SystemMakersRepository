Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink,
and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun
moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence
atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be
done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.

It was July 21, 1969, and Neil Armstrong awoke with a pick-me-up start. It was the day he would become the first
human being to ever walk on the moon. The journey had begun several days earlier, when on July 16th,
the Apollo 11 launched from Earth headed into outer space. On board with Neil Armstrong were Michael
Collins and Buzz Aldrin. The crew landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility a day before the actual
walk. Upon Neil's first step onto the moon's surface, he declared, "That's one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind. It sure was!".
