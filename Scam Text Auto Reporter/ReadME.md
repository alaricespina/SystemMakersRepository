## Scam Text Auto Reporter
This part of the repository contains necessary resources for building the Scam Text Auto Reporter App
(A catchier name is needed)

Possible Flow for this application:
- Require Access to the messages default application of the user
- Read the messages of the user (Iterate through each of the messages) and look for spam/scam messages
- Proceed to take a screenshot of the message if it is a scam/spam message
- Save the number, message content to the data file, screenshot would be sent to a different website for storage (Cloud storage service, AWS maybe?)
- Review / Cleanup the data to email through the appropriate authorities
